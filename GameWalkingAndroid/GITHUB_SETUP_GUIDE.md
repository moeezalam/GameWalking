# GitHub Setup Guide for GameWalking

## üîç Security Check Complete ‚úÖ

I've reviewed both projects for sensitive information. Here's what I found and cleaned:

### ‚úÖ **Safe to Upload:**
- All source code files
- Configuration templates
- Documentation files
- Build scripts
- Installation guides

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cleaned/Removed:**
- **Specific IP addresses** (replaced with placeholders like `[YOUR_PC_IP]`)
- **Personal paths** (replaced with generic examples)
- **Generated files** (added to .gitignore)

### üö´ **Excluded via .gitignore:**
- Configuration files with actual settings (`gamewalking_config.ini`)
- Build outputs (`dist/`, `build/`)
- IDE files (`.idea/`, `.vscode/`)
- Personal data files

## üöÄ GitHub Upload Instructions

### Option 1: Create Two Separate Repositories (Recommended)

#### Repository 1: GameWalking-Android
```bash
# Navigate to Android project
cd GameWalking

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: GameWalking Android app with step detection and UDP communication"

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GameWalking-Android.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### Repository 2: GameWalking-Windows
```bash
# Navigate to Windows project
cd GameWalkingWindows

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: GameWalking Windows desktop app with UDP listener and keyboard simulation"

# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GameWalking-Windows.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Single Repository with Subfolders

```bash
# Create main project directory
mkdir GameWalking-Complete
cd GameWalking-Complete

# Copy both projects
cp -r ../GameWalking ./android/
cp -r ../GameWalkingWindows ./windows/

# Copy main documentation
cp ../COMPLETE_GAMEWALKING_GUIDE.md ./README.md

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete GameWalking system - Android app and Windows desktop application"

# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GameWalking.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## üìã Pre-Upload Checklist

### ‚úÖ **Files Ready for GitHub:**

**Android Project:**
- [x] Source code cleaned of personal IPs
- [x] Default IP set to placeholder "youripaddress"
